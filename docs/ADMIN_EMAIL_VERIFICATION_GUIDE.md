- **Verification emails** expire after 24 hours by default
- **Failed attempts** are tracked for security

### Best Practices:
1. **Verify manually** only when email delivery issues are confirmed
2. **Send verification email** first to maintain security
3. **Reset verification** if email security is compromised
4. **Check verification history** before taking actions
